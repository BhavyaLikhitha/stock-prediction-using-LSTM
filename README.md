# Stock-prediction-using-LSTM
An in-depth project focused on precise stock price prediction through LSTM-based machine learningÂ techniques.
This repository contains a Python script for stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It utilizes historical stock data from Yahoo Finance (yfinance library) and implements deep learning techniques for forecasting stock prices.

# Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
yfinance
Scikit-learn
Keras

# Usage
Modify the stock_symbol, start_date, and end_date variables to specify the stock you want to predict and the date range for historical data.

Run the script to download historical stock data, preprocess it, and build an LSTM-based model for prediction.

The model is saved as keras_model.h5 after training.

The script also includes code to visualize the predicted stock prices against the original prices.

# Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need to explore and experiment with deep learning techniques for financial data analysis
